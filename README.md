Project Repository Structure
This repository is organized to streamline data processing, modeling, and UI integration for the project. Below is an overview of each folder and its purpose.

File to Run
main_app.py: The main entry point for running the project. This script leverages various modules from the src directory to function.
Folder Structure
📂 data_dump
This folder is used for storing any intermediate data generated during processing.

📂 data_processing
Contains scripts that handle data-related operations, including downloading, processing, and feature engineering.

data_download.py: Download all project data using this script. All raw data sources are processed here before further use.

feature_engineering.py: Handles all data manipulation and feature engineering for the project.

(Feel free to add additional scripts here if needed for data processing)

📂 final_data
Stores the final datasets to be used for model training. All custom datasets generated through the Model UI are stored here.

📂 model
Holds all modeling-related scripts, including training and prediction modules.

train_model.py: Script to train models.

predict_model.py: Reads the trained model from train_model.py and performs predictions on the specified dataset.

(Add additional model-related scripts if required)

📂 model_artifacts
This folder stores models trained by train_model.py. Only a single pre-trained model (used by Product UI) will be retained here. Models generated through the Model UI by the evaluator will also be stored here.

📂 raw_data
Stores downloaded raw data, structured into subfolders:

cricksheet_data: Contains raw data downloaded exclusively from Cricksheet.

Additional_data: Stores raw data from other sources, if applicable.

📂 UI
This folder contains all files related to the user interface.

📂 rest
Use this folder for any requirements not covered by the above categories.
